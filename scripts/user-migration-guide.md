## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**

**I recommend Option A (Self-Registration)** because:
- ✅ Users control their own passwords
- ✅ No manual work for you
- ✅ Users get familiar with new system
- ✅ Immediate access once they sign up

**Just send the email to all 9 users and they can sign up themselves!**

## 🔧 **AFTER MIGRATION:**

1. **Test each user can log in**
2. **Verify their roles are correct** 
3. **Remove old NextAuth code** (I can help with this)
4. **Update any user management features**

---

## 📞 **SUPPORT:**

If any user has issues:
1. **Check Clerk Dashboard** for their account
2. **Resend invitation** if needed
3. **Manually verify their email** in Clerk
4. **Contact me** for technical issues

**This approach is much simpler and more reliable than automatic migration!**
